// Ported from cordon crates/bpf/src/kernel.rs @ b40a8c7 (Apache-2.0) — renamed the common crate, removed cgroup-class and open/exec-only helpers, and inlined `caller_exe` for the verifier gate.
//! The unsafe boundary: every read of kernel memory lives here, behind safe typed
//! handles, so the decision flow in `main.rs` is `unsafe`-free.
//!
//! ## No committed struct layout — offsets come from the running kernel
//! There is no `vmlinux.rs` here. rustc can't emit CO-RE relocations
//! (rust-lang/rust#158412), so a generated binding would pin this object to the
//! layout of whatever kernel it was *built* against and silently read garbage on any
//! other. Instead every field is read at a byte offset taken from [`OFFSETS`] — a
//! `.rodata` global the daemon fills from the running kernel's BTF and injects at
//! load time. The handles below (`File`, `Dentry`, …) are `Copy` newtypes over a raw
//! base address; each accessor reads one field at its injected offset.
//!
//! [`read_at`] (a `bpf_probe_read_kernel`, the kernel's *fault-safe* reader: a bad
//! address faults into an `Err` instead of crashing) does all the actually-unsafe
//! work. Accessors return [`Option`] — `None` ("couldn't read") becomes a fail-open
//! allow in the caller.
//!
//! There is **no path resolution** here: `bpf_d_path` is not allowed at the
//! `file_open` LSM hook, so both subtrees and executables are identified by inode
//! ([`FileId`]).
