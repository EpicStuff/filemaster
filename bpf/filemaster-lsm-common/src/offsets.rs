// Ported from cordon crates/bpf-common/src/offsets.rs @ b40a8c7 (Apache-2.0) — unchanged apart from the crate rename.
//! Running-kernel struct field offsets — the portability shim that replaces a
//! build-time-pinned `vmlinux.rs`.
//!
//! The eBPF program cannot generate CO-RE relocations (rustc has no
//! `preserve_access_index`; see rust-lang/rust#158412), so it cannot hard-code the
//! layout of `struct file`, `dentry`, `inode`, … against the kernel it was *built*
//! on and expect those offsets to hold on the kernel it *runs* on. Instead the
//! program reads every field at an offset taken from this struct, which the daemon
//! fills by parsing the **running** kernel's BTF (`/sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux`) and
//! injects into the program's `.rodata` at load time (aya `override_global`). One
//! object, every kernel — CO-RE's portability, done in userspace.
//!
//! Each field is the **byte** offset of one kernel field, named
//! `struct_field` (or `struct_field_subfield` for a nested hop). They are read on
//! the hot path, so they are plain `u32` (every real offset fits) laid out `repr(C)`
//! to match byte-for-byte across the two crates. The daemon resolves them by member
//! *name*, transparently descending anonymous unions — so a field the kernel tucks
//! inside an anonymous union (e.g. `mm_struct.exe_file`) is still found.

/// Symbol name of the eBPF-side `.rodata` global the daemon injects offsets into.
/// The program declares `#[unsafe(no_mangle)] static OFFSETS: Offsets` (the attribute
/// needs a literal, so the two can't share this const directly — they must match by
/// hand); the loader patches it by this name (aya `override_global`).
