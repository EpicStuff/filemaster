// Ported from cordon crates/bpf-common/src/policy_maps.rs @ b40a8c7 (Apache-2.0) — unchanged apart from the crate rename.
//! The flat **rule model** schema (DESIGN §15) — the compiled, pre-resolved
//! decision table both sides agree on, byte-for-byte.
//!
//! The userspace compiler (`cordon_core::policy::compile`) lowers an expressive
//! text policy — groups, nesting, object precedence — into this dumb form: a set of
//! protected objects, each with a flat, **pre-sorted** list of [`CompiledRule`]s.
//! Object precedence and inheritance are resolved *there* (copy-down), so the eBPF
//! program only ever does: most-specific protected object → **first matching** rule
//! in its one bucket (DESIGN §15.3 — "expressive source, dumb-fast binary form").
//!
//! This module is the contract for that binary form — and the only enforcement schema
//! now that the v1 owner model (`SUBTREES`/`OWNER_IDS`) has been retired. The three
//! rule maps are **double-buffered** (see the map-name section): each holds two
//! generations, and `Settings.active_bank` picks the live one, so `cordon policy apply`
//! publishes a whole new table with one atomic flip (DESIGN §15.8).

// ## Double-buffer (atomic apply)
// All three rule maps are **banked**: each holds two independent generations (banks
// `0` and `1`), and `Settings.active_bank` selects which the kernel reads. A
// `cordon policy apply` fills the *inactive* bank, then flips `active_bank` in one
// atomic `SETTINGS` write — an RCU-style generation flip (DESIGN §15.8). The kernel
// reads the active bank only; the inactive one is the next apply's scratch space, so
// a re-seed is never half-visible (no clear-then-insert window).

/// `HashMap<BankedFile, ObjId>` — every protected object's `(bank, dev, ino)` → its
