// Ported from cordon crates/bpf-common/src/maps.rs @ b40a8c7 (Apache-2.0) — unchanged apart from the crate rename.
//! The map names and POD records shared between the eBPF program and the loader
//! that are **not** part of the per-object rule table (that lives in
//! [`crate::policy_maps`]): the `(dev,inode)` [`FileId`] used everywhere as inode
//! identity, the one-element [`Settings`] control record, and the [`DecisionEvent`]
//! pushed on the ring buffer.
//!
//! Identity is inode, not path: the eBPF program cannot resolve paths at the
//! `file_open` LSM hook (`bpf_d_path` is not allowed there), so the daemon resolves
//! paths to `(dev,inode)` via `stat(2)` + the mount table at seed time, and both the
//! protected object and the caller's executable are matched by [`FileId`].
